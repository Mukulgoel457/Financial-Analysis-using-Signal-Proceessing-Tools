# Financial Analysis using Signal Processing Tools

## Overview

This project explores the application of signal processing techniques in financial markets analysis. It aims to extract meaningful patterns and trends from stock market data that traditional analytical methods might overlook. Using tools from both Python and MATLAB environments, this project combines innovative algorithms with financial theories to predict stock movements and volatility.

## Project Files Description

- **Code Explanation.pdf**: Contains detailed explanations of the algorithms and their implementations.
- **Project code(py).ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook is where all the Python-based analysis is performed.
- **Project Documentation(Final).pdf**: Includes the entire project report with methodology, results, and discussions.
- **Project_code(MATLAB).m.txt**: Contains MATLAB scripts used for part of the analysis, demonstrating the application of signal processing in another scientific computing environment.
- **Testing Data (TCS.NS).csv & Testing Data (TCS2.NS).csv**: These datasets include historical stock prices used to test the algorithms developed.
